# MEGmotorPython

These scripts have been written to read and analyze MEG data. I've commented the scripts thoroughly in order to make them usable and editable for people who are new to Python. 

There are quite a few places where there's room for improvement: function and variable naming, reducing redundacy, improving efficiency and so on.
